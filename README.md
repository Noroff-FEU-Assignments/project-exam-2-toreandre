# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and is my exam 2 delivery.

Please note: As mentioned in the report, you need to add --forced when installing this repo!

## Available Scripts

### `npm install --forced`

In the project dirctory you can install the project. You must add the --forced parameter due to a version mismatch between the mapbox react wrapper and the mapbox js library.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
